1. prgm_mrphy_delay_app

The prgm_mrphy_delay_app needs to be run only once after every boot. This
application would read the delays in the mrphy ip from its registers using
the sysfs enteries provided.
This application after reading all the delays from mrphy ip, calculates the 
total Egress and Ingress delays and programs the same into the XGMAC register
again using the sysfs enteries provided.

This is required for applications like TSN and PTP.

The binaries of these applications can be found in /home/root/

Usage of the application
--------------------------------
1. The application if executed without any parameters assumes that the sysfs enteries are
   available at the location /sys/devices/platform/soc\@0/10810000.ethernet/net/eth0/
   If this is the location of the sysfs of eth0, then the application alone can be executed as
   
   ./prgm_mrphy_delay_app

2. If the sysfs of eth0 has a different location, then the path needs to be provided as below-
   ./prgm_mrphy_delay_app /path/to/sysfs


Using either of the above methods, and once executed, the application shows the values programmed
in the Egress and Ingress registers of XGMAC with a successfull message at the end.
